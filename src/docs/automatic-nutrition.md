## Setup

3.  Once you have completed these fields, click the `Register` button:

## Usage

Now that you’ve complete the registration process, it’s time to actually use Automatic Nutrition calculator for your recipe!

1.  Go to `Posts > Add New` to create a new post for the recipe.
2.  In this example, we will create a recipe called, \`Best Brownies For Mom\` so enter that as the post title. This was borrowed from [Tupperware](http://blog.tupperware.com/recipes/best-brownies-for-mom/).
3.  Click the Zip Recipes icon from the toolbar:

5.  Then we enter the number of servings in `Yields` field and click \`Calculate Nutrition\` button:

    ![](https://www.ziprecipes.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Edit_Post_‹_Stage_Blog_—_WordPress-3-600x259.png)If we scroll further down, we will see nutrition values have been auto-populated:

7.  Let’s click `Add Recipe`, and then view the published recipe with nutrition label. In this example, we’re using the `Canada` premium recipe card theme.  
    ![](https://www.ziprecipes.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Best_Brownies_For_Mom_–_Stage_Blog-356x600.png)When we scroll to the bottom of the recipe, we see the detailed `nutrition facts label`:

8.  When users put their mouse over the nutrition label, a tooltip will show up explaining what they’re looking at. In our example, it will say `Nutrition label for Best Brownies For Mom`. This will help with Google Image ranking and your nutrition label with your blog name may appear when people search for `Nutrition label for ____:

    `

## Guidelines

 If you follow those guideline you will ensure that Zip Recipes will always correctly recognize the content of your recipe.

There is really one basic rule - *if another person can understand an ingredient line you wrote without having to stop and think about what it contains*, then we will understand it correctly too.

Ingredient line guidelines:
- Always include an ingredient quantity: `3 oz butter cookies` is preferable to `butter cookies or tuiles`
- Shorten and simplify the line: `2 cans garbanzo beans, drained` is preferable to `2-2 1/2 cans of washed and drained garbanzo beans`
- If possible do not include more than one alternative to an ingredient in a line: `2 red or yellow peppers` is preferable to `2 red, yellow or green peppers`
- We prefer to have only one ingredient per line although we can handle too ingredients: `2 eggs` is preferable to `2 eggs and 1 cup grated cheese`
- If oil is used for frying, indicate so in the ingredient line (add the words `for frying`), so we can accurately calculate how much gets absorbed. Example: `1 qt olive oil for frying` or just `oil for frying`
- For stocks and broths, include `stock` or `broth` in the recipe title, **so we can accurately calculate the remaining nutritional value once it's strained**.
- For marinates and brining, please include at the end of each ingredient line for the marinade the words `for the marinade` or `for brining`
- For `salt and pepper` without quantity attached we apply an algorithm which applies value for salt and pepper based on recipe weight
- Avoid adding complicated cooking instructions within the ingredient line: `2 large carrots, sliced or chopped` is preferred to `2 large carrots, chopped for blanching in the chicken broth`
